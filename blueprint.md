plan how you will create the app the feature,capabilities


app function(how it look and work)
look: basic fb style 
work: also same as fb posting,creating user 

must have:
secure authentication, good error handling , easy and efficeint navigation, 
also noh execuse code(code that work only under a certain condition),an mvc structure,
use classes mostly and uses .env to store environment variale

Database:



feature: simple login,signup,posting and commeting 

capabilities: an fb like app where user post or comment on to other user post and of course signup and login 



make a simple one first then make it advance over time

i will focus mostly on backend and i dont care much for frontend so i can just coppy and gpt that shit

# Step 1 data base
    1.create ui with admin lte 
        -becuase am loss and dont know how to do without looking at shit first✔
        - i will actaully just make this just like 
    2.connect to controller 

# Step 2 data base
    1.table user,post,comment✔
    2.


# Step 3 config
    session



# Step 4 login
    1.config the login controller



# Step 5 login


# Step 6 Post
    i need admin lte since i need to expand it an actual app even if i this is not a good langague for it i will still make it, i feel if i do this i would need to learn javescript again which am not against its just that for now i will focus on making this with php then if i want to expand it with other language to nake it betteer i will but for nw focus on php, do it one at the time only learn javescrip when you need to use it not because you wnat to be 'all rounder' learn a skill when you need to use it except math i need to learn that regardless not only fro ai but for stat



# expand
    since i plan to expand this i need to plan this carefully so that i can easily manupulate or change thing so that i dont have to fucking recode the entire thing when i add javascript or some new shit, make everything reusable , maintanable ,no shortcut code (it works but shit that good enough)
